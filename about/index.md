## Hey there, nice to meet you!

I'm a management consultant based in NYC. I love working with large organizations eager to move from endless "strategy and planning" to actually making stuff. Today that often includes technology and, more often, the teams necessary to build great digital products. My research and expertise focus on cross-functionality in organization design and how that affects large, strategic initiatives especially those including new technology.

I do this full time @ [McCallum & Partners](https://mccallumpartners.org) as the founder and pretty much sole employee.

**My work involves:**

*  Discovering latent capability in organizations.
*  Coaching executives on what it *actually* means to "go digital."
*  Examining structural (skills, capital, market) effects on team morale and potential.
*  Identifying meaningful starting-points for transformation efforts.
*  Looking for talent that's ready (and able) for a challenge.
*  Scrubbing in as a data scientist and crunching stats for any of the above activities.

Before starting my own company, I worked as a civil servant in the Federal Government with a bunch of great folk at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov): public servants helping other public servants modernize their approach to mission. We improved the workings of bureaucracy through prototypes, transformation initiatives, user-centered research, assisted acquisitions, and even full-blown product builds. I was the product manager for this, fairly important, [project](https://github.com/18F/culper/wiki) that rebuilt how federal employees apply for security and suitability investigations, i.e. background checks and security clearances.

Prior to government service I worked in the private sector on multiple reorganizations including financial services firms and other highly regulated industries. Restructuring, product development, cross-disciplinary teams, APIs, opportunity costs, and design sprints are words that perk my ears.

**Example projects:**

* Advised the United States Navy on a platform that helps sailors manage their career.
* Worked with leadership [here](https://www.argolimited.com/pages/argo-group-home) to create three digital teams across the country that are building great product [here](eager.to).
*  Rebuilt compliance architecture, operations, and tools at a global bank.
*  Developed a common mission for marketing with the biggest snacks and beverage maker in the world.
*  Tested and released a global payroll automation for the largest investment bank.

In my spare time you can find me hiking a National Park, jamming out to some classic rock, reading economic history, drinking fancy coffee, or pouring over management documents from the 19th Century at the Library of Congress.

Speaking of coffee, let's grab some if you're in NYC, [first cup's on me.](/coffee)
